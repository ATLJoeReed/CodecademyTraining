    "Say you work for a major social media website. Your boss always says \"data drives all our decisions\" and it seems to be true. Metrics are collected on all users of your website, terabytes of data stored in replicated databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, your boss wants to know if college students are engaging in your website. You pull up the records for users in that age bracket and look at them one by one. The first person only spent half a second on your website before closing the tab, that doesn't look good. But the second person was on the site for thirty minutes! That's a running average of 15 minutes site time per user, but you still have half a million records to look at. On top of that, you need to compare it against other age brackets (and the average overall). That's going to take a lot of time if you do it all by hand, and you're still not sure what your methodology for proving college students spend enough time on your website to be \"engaged\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysts attempt to say meaningful things about the persuasions of people. Often, we want to know if a change or difference we see in a dataset is \"real\" or if it’s just a normal fluctuation or a result of the specific sample of people we have chosen to measure. A difference we observe in our data is only important if we can be reasonably sure that it is representative of the population as a whole, and reasonably sure that our result is repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question of whether a difference is significant or not is essential to making decisions based on that difference. Some instances where this might come up include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performing an A/B test — are the different observations really the results of different conditions (i.e., Condition A vs. Condition B)? Or just the result of random chance?\n",
    "* Conducting a survey — is the fact that men gave slightly different responses than women a real difference between men and women? Or just the result of chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover the fundamental concepts that will help us create tests to measure our confidence in our statistical results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample means and population means\n",
    "* The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "* Why we use hypothesis tests\n",

You fire up your data-science stack in Python and first check the average time -- which turns out to be near 11 whole minutes!

    "Perhaps, this time, you're a tailor of school uniforms at a middle school. You need to know the average height of people from 10-13 years old in order to know which sizes to make the uniforms. Knowing the best decisions are based on data, you set out to do some research at your local middle school. Organizing with the school, you measure the heights of some students. Their average height is 57.5 inches. You know a little about sampling and decide that measuring 30 out of the 300 students gives enough data to assume 57.5 inches is roughly the average height of everyone at the middle school. You set to work with this dimension and make uniforms that fit people of this height, some smaller and some larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when you go about making your uniforms many reports come back saying that they are too small. Something must have gone wrong with your decision-making process! You go back to collect the rest of the data: you measure the sixth graders one day (56.7, not so bad), the seventh graders after that (59 inches tall on average), and the eighth graders the next day (61.7 inches!). Your sample mean was so far off from your population mean. How did this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, your sample selection was skewed to one direction of the total population. It looks like you must have measured more sixth graders than is representative of the whole middle school. How do you get an average sample height that looks more like the average population height?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we looked at different sets of samples taken from a population and how the mean of each set could be different from the population mean. This is a natural consequence of the fact that a set of samples has less data than the population to which it belongs. If our sample selection is poor then we will have a sample mean seriously skewed from our population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one surefire way to mitigate the risk of having a skewed sample mean — take a larger set of samples. The sample mean of a larger sample set will more closely approximate the population mean. This phenomenon, known as the Central Limit Theorem, states that if we have a large enough sample size, all of our sample means will be sufficiently close to the population mean.\n",

Suppose that a product manager wants the average age of visitors to BuyPie.com to be 30. In the past hour, the website had 100 visitors and the average age was 31. Are the visitors too old? Or is this just the result of chance and a small sample size?\n",
